## What is This Project?

This project is a Note Taker application designed to help users write and save notes.

- **Why Did I Make This?**: To practice and enhance my skills in JavaScript and Node.js by creating a dynamic and interactive note-taking application. This project also taught me more about using Express.js for building a backend server.
- **What's in It?**: The application includes a main page where users can view, add, and manage notes. Users can add new notes, delete existing notes, and view the details of each note. The notes are saved to a JSON file on the server, allowing for persistent data.
- **What Did I Learn?**: This project helped me understand the integration of various JavaScript libraries and as always, the importance of good console logs and error handling. I learned about setting up a server with Express.js, handling file operations in Node.js.
